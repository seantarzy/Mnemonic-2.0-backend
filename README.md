### Getting Started
This project is created in conjunction with this [frontend](https://github.com/seanytdawg/Mnemonic-2.0-front-end). 

To start the backend server:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install all dependencies by running ```$ bundle install```
3. Be sure you have a [Postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/) server running.
4. Create your database table by running ```$ rails db:create```
5. Migrate to set up your database schema by running ```$ rails db:migrate```.
6. Register and receive an authorization token from [Genius](https://docs.genius.com/).
7. Add a ```.env``` file in the root directory that contains ```GENIUS_API_KEY=<YOUR_GENIUS_AUTHORIZATION_TOKEN>```.
8. Run ```$ rails server``` to start your server. 
9. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3001/ to access the backend routes or follow the [frontend README](https://github.com/Jackmt9/mnemonic-maker-frontend/blob/master/README.md).
